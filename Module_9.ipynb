It defines a set of constraints for how web services should operate, primarily focusing on resources and their representation. Key principles include:\n",

An **API specification** (or API documentation) is a comprehensive contract that describes how an API works and how developers can interact with it. It details the endpoints available, the HTTP methods supported for each endpoint, the request and response formats (e.g., JSON schema), authentication requirements, error codes, and any other relevant information. In building a Flask API, an API specification helps maintain consistency, clarify communication between backend and frontend developers, and can even be used to auto-generate code or interactive documentation using tools like `Flask-RESTX` (which integrates Swagger/OpenAPI)."

                "\n",
                "**Answer:** **HTTP status codes** are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's HTTP request. They indicate the outcome of the request (e.g., success, client error, server error). They are crucial in a Flask API because:\n",
                "-   **Communication:** They provide standardized, machine-readable feedback to the client about the request's result.\n",
                "-   **Client Behavior:** Clients (web browsers, mobile apps) rely on these codes to determine how to proceed (e.g., retry, show an error message).\n",
                "-   **Debugging:** Helps in troubleshooting API issues.\n",
                "-   **Standardization:** Ensures consistent API responses across different services.\n",
                "\n",
                "**Common codes:**\n",
                "-   `2xx` (Success): `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`.\n",
                "-   `4xx` (Client Error): `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `405 Method Not Allowed`.\n",

                "\n",
                "**Answer:** You handle `POST` requests in Flask by specifying `methods=['POST']` in the `@app.route()` decorator for a particular view function. Inside the function, you typically access the data sent in the request body using the `request` object, often `request.form` for form data or `request.json` (or `request.get_json()`) for JSON data.\n",

                "-   **Authentication:** Verify the identity of the client (e.g., JWT, OAuth, API Keys).\n",
                "-   **Authorization:** Control what authenticated clients can access or modify.\n",
                "-   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication and prevent eavesdropping.\n",
                "-   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).\n",
                "-   **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make (e.g., `Flask-Limiter`).\n",
                "-   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Properly configure CORS headers to restrict which domains can access your API (e.g., `Flask-CORS`).\n",
                "-   **Error Handling:** Provide generic error messages and avoid leaking sensitive information in error responses.\n",
                "-   **Secret Key:** Use a strong `app.secret_key` for session management and other security-sensitive operations."

It acts like a dictionary that stores data on the server-side, but it's managed by sending a signed cookie to the client's browser. The role of the session object is to:\n",
