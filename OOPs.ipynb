                "**Answer:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). The primary goal of OOP is to model real-world entities into software objects to manage complexity and improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability. The core principles of OOP are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction (EIPA)."

A class doesn't store data itself; it only defines the structure and behavior for the objects. Think of a class `Dog` as the blueprint for all dogs, defining that every dog has a `name` and can `bark()`, but not specifying a specific dog's name."

These methods are also known as magic methods or special methods. They allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in Python operations and functions. For example, `__init__` is the constructor, `__str__` defines the string representation of an object, and `__add__` defines the behavior of the `+` operator."

This promotes code reuse and establishes a logical hierarchy. The child class can extend or override the functionality of the parent class. For example, a `Dog` class and a `Cat` class can both inherit from an `Animal` class, sharing common attributes like `name` and `age`."

                "**Answer:** Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In OOP, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The most common form of polymorphism in Python is method overriding, where a method in a child class has the same name and signature as a method in its parent class, but with a different implementation. This allows a single function call to behave differently based on the type of object it's acting upon. For example, a `speak()` method could be called on both `Dog` and `Cat` objects, but a `Dog` object would `print(\"Bark!\")` and a `Cat` object would `print(\"Meow!\")`."

                "- **Private Members (Name Mangling):** A double leading underscore (`__`) is used for attributes.

The `self` parameter in the constructor refers to the newly created instance of the class."

                "**Answer:** Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but different signatures (i.e., a different number or type of parameters). Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense like languages such as Java or C++. If you define multiple methods with the same name, the last one defined will override the previous ones. However, you can achieve similar functionality using default arguments or variable-length arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`)."

This enables a child object to behave differently than a parent object when that method is called. When the method is called on an object, Python's dynamic dispatch determines which version of the method (parent or child) to execute based on the object's actual type."

This allows you to define a method that can be accessed without using parentheses, making it feel like a simple attribute. It is often used to implement getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes, providing a cleaner way to manage attribute access and validation without breaking existing code that uses direct attribute access. It's a way to provide encapsulation and control over how an attribute is accessed or modified."

It allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes, as long as those classes share a common interface (e.g., they all have a method with the same name). This makes the code easier to maintain and extend, as you can add new classes that conform to the same interface without having to modify the existing code that uses them."

Abstract classes often contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared without an implementation. Any concrete subclass that inherits from the abstract class must provide an implementation for all of its abstract methods.

                "**Answer:** In Python, polymorphism with inheritance is achieved through method overriding and dynamic dispatch. When a method is called on an object, Python looks for the method in the object's class. If it's not found, it moves up the inheritance hierarchy (according to the MRO) until it finds a matching method. The method from the most specific class (the child class) is executed. This allows objects of different subclasses to respond to the same method call in different ways, demonstrating polymorphism."
